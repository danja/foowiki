# FooWiki
A minimal [SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)

As it stands it's suitable for use as a personal wiki. It uses [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) editing syntax. It doesn't contain features like page locking or authentication (feel free to add these!).

It's very much a work-in-progress, definitely a bit of fun, but I'm already using it for note taking.

All FooWiki needs is a (static file) HTTP server and a SPARQL 1.1 server, i.e. **no server-side code**. It's being developed against [Fuseki](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/), the Jena SPARQL server (which has a built-in HTTP server) and the instructions below follow this setup. (Please let me know if you get it running against a different SPARQL server, I'll include notes here).

I'm aiming for it being a "living system", see [Foo](#Foo).

Some old notes on how it works:

## Status

*Work in progress!*

**2020-04-28** : adding bookmarking functionality. The semweb-native style for doing this might be something along the lines of:

```
    <http://example.org> dc:title "Page Title" ;
                         dc:description "Stuff about the page" .

    <http://hyperdata.it/bookmarks/id1234> a :Bookmark ;
          :target <http://example.org> .
```      

*but* the way FooWiki is setup at the moment is geared around having the wiki page as the central entity.

`
<http://hyperdata.it/wiki/PageX> a wiki:Page ;
                    dc:title "Page Title" ;
                    dc:description "Stuff about the page" .
`
So I reckon it'll be easiest to do a simple extension of the current usage, munging the data together:

<http://hyperdata.it/wiki/id1234> a h:Bookmark ;
                    dc:title "Page Title" ;
                    dc:description "Stuff about the page" ;
                    h:target  <http://example.org> .
`

**2019-04-23** : the local server I was running this on is failing, so I decided to put this on my main laptop. This revealed several issues, so I've made the minimum necessary changes to get it working.

## Installation

FooWiki is available via a Docker image, see https://github.com/danja/docker-hyperdata
That means of installation is recommended.
Also the notes here are a little out-of-date, the information over there is much more reliable.

First clone the FooWiki files somewhere convenient. These will be served as regular HTML.

Next download Fuseki according to the [instructions](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/). Then adjust the configuration according to your setup and run it. There are three files to consider for this:

1. the Fuseki config file - the one provided as foowiki/etc/seki-config.ttl includes a suitable store definition (called seki)
2. a script to run Fuseki pointing at its config file - the one provided as foowiki/etc/run-fuseki.bat should help as a starting point
3. the FuWiki config file, foowiki/js/config.js - the one provided is the one I use against the two files above



### Checking Fuseki
Assuming you have a setup close to this, opening http://localhost:3030 should take you to the Fuseki pages. Click on Control Panel. When offered, select the /seki dataset. You should now see Fuseki's raw SPARQL interface.

### Bootstrap Data
It's easiest to bootstrap the Wiki with a few pages. Open http://localhost:3030/foowiki/index.html in a browser and go to Upload RDF at the bottom of the page, click Select Files and navigate to foowiki/examples/pages.ttl, select it then click Upload. (Currently you will need to use the back button to get back to http://localhost:3030/foowiki/index.html and refresh the browser to see the page list).

You may wish to customise the graph name, it's specified in foowiki/js/config.js. If so, either do a search/replace in pages.ttl or skip the file upload and go straight to a (non-existent) page by pointing your browser at a URL of the form '''http://localhost:3030/foowiki/page.html?uri=http://hyperdata.it/wiki/Hello%20World'''.

## Using FooWiki
Opening http://localhost:3030/foowiki/index.html in a browser will display a list of pages in the Wiki. From there it should be self-explanatory, if not, let me know.

## Foo!
This is an experimental feature, the aim being in-app runtime extensibility via executable wiki pages (Javascript or *maybe* SPARQL). Think [emacs lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) or [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#reflection) reflection. Ultimately I'd like it to have a relatively small core/kernel of static HTML/JS with everything else being maintained as RDF data.
Towards this, in addition to the core pages (see below) there's also a run.html which when called via a pattern like http://localhost:3030/foowiki/run.html?uri=http://hyperdata.it/wiki/Hello%20World%202 will run the source in the content of that page. There are examples in the sample data: HelloWorld1 and HelloWorld2 (more docs to follow once I've played with it a bit).

### Why "FooWiki"?
Initially I called this thing FuWiki as it uses Fuseki as a back end. But then I needed a name for the reflection bit so used the standard [metasyntactic variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) [foo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo).

## How it works
Most of the code appears as jQuery-flavoured Javascript inside the core HTML files (index.html, page.html and edit.html). Could do with refactoring :)

Queries are composed using simple templating on foowiki/js/sparql-templates.js. The XML results are (crudely) parsed out using jQuery. Interaction with the SPARQL server is done using jQuery Ajax. Markdown parsing is done by the marked.js lib. Rendering of HTML content blocks is done by more templating on foowiki/js/html-templates.js.

There's some sample data etc. in the foowiki/examples/ directory.

## 'Static' Rendering
There are copies of the scripts used to render pages (index-static.html, core-static.js etc) with all links to editing facilities removed. This is to provide a static archive of the content. Making the archive this way is not straightforward as for the content to be visible, the Javascript has to be run in a browser. So I'm working on a [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)-based crawler to sort this out (and dump the content as files).

I've nearly implemented this, but it's since occurred to me that it would be easier to pull the content directly from the SPARQL store with a script, ignoring the browser rendering altogether.  

## Date Issue
At some point I changed the date handling from a simple dc:date for each post to a dc:created and dc:modified

The following was needed to patch the older data - run in the Fuseki admin console, downloaded and then uploaded to the graph :

PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>   

CONSTRUCT {
    ?s  dc:created ?date .
    ?s  dc:modified ?date .
}
FROM <http://hyperdata.it/wiki>  
WHERE {
    ?s dc:date ?date
}

I plan to use the same data model in [Seki](https://github.com/danja/seki) (middleware/a front-end for connecting to an independent SPARQL server using node.js) and [Thiki](https://github.com/danja/thiki) (Personal Wiki for Android Devices).
